# PHT OpenFOAM Lab53 IACP FEB RAS

OpenFOAM solvers for simulating heat transfer processes in porous media (porous heat transfer, PHT)

# Overview

In project **PHT OpenFOAM Lab53 IACP FEB RAS**, we develop the OpenFOAM solvers and libraries to simulate the transient fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media. The solvers are developed in the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of [Institute of Automation and Control Processes FEB RAS](www.iacp.dvo.ru) and [Far Eastern Federal University](www.dvfu.ru).

**phtEnthalpyFoam** &mdash; fluid flow in porous media without phase changes and chemical reactions. This solver allows one to simulate flows through the "inert" porous materials like rocks, metallic balls, etc. as in sensible heat thermal energy storage or flow through the self-heating porous media.

**porousHeatTransferFoam** &mdash; fluid flow in porous media. Optional modeling of phase transitions in the condenced phase like granular PCM. This solver allows one to model flows in packed bed thermal energy storages with phase changes.

# Description

The solvers were developed on [OpenFOAM from OpenCFD](www.openfoam.com) and tested for version v2412. Please do the following steps to compile:

1. Download ZIP this project from Github and, through the prompt, move it to your $HOME/OpenFOAM Ubuntu directory. 
2. Unzip the archive by running "unzip pht-openfoam-lab53iacp-master.zip" and run "mv pht-openfoam-lab53iacp-master OpenFOAM-PHT53IACP" in the prompt.
3. Run "echo 'source $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-PHT53IACP/etc/bashrc' >> ~/.bashrc" in the prompt.
4. Run ". $HOME/.bashrc" in the prompt.
5. Change directory to OpenFOAM-PHT53IACP and run ./Allwmake script.
